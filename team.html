                            <p>Aparna is a doctoral researcher in the Department of Animal Science at Texas A&M University, working under the guidance of Dr. Karun Kaniyamattam. My research focuses on resource efficiency in dairy production systems, with a particular emphasis on analyzing the interlinked use of water, energy, and feed in modern dairy farms. By applying systems modeling and decision science approaches, my work aims to improve the sustainability, resilience, and productivity of livestock systems.

                                Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked on the development of a system dynamics model for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD). This project combined epidemiological modeling and simulation to better understand disease transmission pathways and to evaluate intervention strategies at the herd and population levels. This experience fostered my interest in integrating animal health, systems modeling, and sustainability into livestock research.
                                
                                My broader research interests include:
                                
                                Systems dynamics modeling for livestock health and production,

                                Decision-support frameworks for livestock producers to enhance resilience under environmental and economic constraints.
